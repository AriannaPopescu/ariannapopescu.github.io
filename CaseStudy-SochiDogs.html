			<h2>Research</h2>
			<div class="step">
				<h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
				<p>To determine whether the current desktop and mobile versions of the website comply with usability and functionality criteria, an analysis was conducted using Nielsen's <strong> 10 heuristics</strong>. 
					This allowed me to identify the <strong>strengths</strong> and <strong>weaknesses</strong> of SochiDogs website.</p>
				
					<h4>Usability and Accessibility</h4>
                    <p>The website is generally <strong>usable</strong>but there are several aspects that need improvement in order to provide an optimal user experience.</p>
                    <p>The site is <strong>not fully accessible</strong>, as it does not comply with WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines (e.g., insufficient contrast between page titles and background, missing alt attributes for images).</p>
                    <p>Overall, the website would benefit from improvements in terms of accessibility, visual design, and user experience to enhance user satisfaction and make it more aligned with current standards.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Learnability:</strong> Initially, the site appears moderately simple, but the lack of spacing between elements, unclear hierarchy, and poor visibility of titles within each page make it difficult to understand.</li>
						<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Users can perform tasks smoothly and find information easily. The site offers several pages with detailed information.</li>
						<li><strong>Memorability:</strong>Users can use the site with the same level of proficiency even after a period of time.</li>
						<li><strong>Errors:</strong> Users can generally avoid errors, thanks to error prevention in the forms. However, some actions cannot be corrected if performed by mistake (e.g., lack of breadcrumbs).</li>
						<li><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> The design is not minimalist and does not align with current trends. The content appears overly compact and does not allow the page to breathe. Additionally, there are some accessibility issues that create difficulties.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
					<img src="assets/images/site-map.png" alt="site-map-iVegan-website">
					
					<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>To determine the<strong>strengths</strong> and <strong>weaknesses</strong>of the SochiDogs website compared to other non-profit organizations that focus on animal rescue and adoption, a comparative analysis was conducted with <strong>5</strong> of its direct competitors.</p>
					<p>The direct competitors are represented by <strong>non-profit organizations</strong> that are involved in <strong>international animal rescue and adoption</strong>.</p>
					<img src="assets/images/table-competitors.png" alt="iVegan-competitors-analysis">
					<h4>&#10233;Analysis Results</h4>
					<p>From the analysis, the differences that the SochiDogs website presents compared to the other analyzed websites have emerged.</p>
					<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Clear and comprehensive <strong>information</strong> about adoptions and the adoption process.</p>
					<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Lack of <strong>breadcrumbs</strong>, <strong>low-quality images</strong>, lack of <strong>filters</strong> on the adoption page, no information about the budget or <strong>finances</strong>, absence of <strong>privacy policy</strong> and <strong>terms and conditions</strong> pages.</p>
					
					<h3>User Research</h3>
					<p>From web and social media research, it emerges that the target audience consists of <strong>animal lovers</strong> of <strong>various ages</strong>. However, since the organization operates internationally, the target is <strong>highly diversified geographically and culturally</strong>.</p>
					<p>To gain a better understanding of the target audience, I have designed a 10-question survey aimed at gathering quantitative and qualitative information. The survey focuses on their <strong>level of technological and web knowledge</strong> and their opinions regarding <strong>features</strong> and <strong>aspects</strong> commonly found on websites.</p>
					<p>To select participants in line with SochiDogs' target audience, I have utilized social media groups for animal lovers and animal adoption. This approach allowed me to gather information from individuals who demonstrate a strong interest in animal welfare and are active online.</p>
                    <p>The survey was created using Google Forms and received 16 responses.</p>
					<img src="assets/images/survey.png" alt="survey-iVegan-website" class="survey">
					<h4>&#10233;Survey Results</h4>
					<p>The majority of participants have an <strong>intermediate level of technological proficiency</strong> (31%) and <strong>use the web daily</strong> (75%).
                        The most important aspects of a website for them are a <strong>professional appearance</strong> and <strong>ease of use</strong>.
                        They consider <strong>filters</strong> to be very important, and the <strong>financial balance/report</strong> is also considered important.</p>
					
					<h3>User Personas</h3>
					<p>With the data optained from the research and survey, i was able to create three <strong>Personas</strong> representing three different user groups, with different expectations, needs and goals.</p>
					<img src="assets/images/user1.png" alt="user persona 1">
					<img src="assets/images/user2.png" alt="user persona 2">
					<img src="assets/images/user3.png" alt="user persona 3">

					<h3>User Journey Map</h3>
					<p>I created a User Journey Map to identify the <strong>pain points</strong> and <strong>feelings</strong> the user may go through while using the current website and the possible <strong>improvement opportunities</strong>.</p>

			<h2>Wireframing</h2>
			<div class="step">
				<h3>Wireframes Mobile and desktop</h3>
				<p>Starting with mobile wireframes, I sketched out the designs on paper. </p>
				<p>Then, I moved on to creating digital wireframes, choosing a screen size of <strong>320x568px</strong> for mobile to ensure optimal design for smaller-sized devices, and <strong>1280x720px</strong> for desktop. I established a <strong>grid</strong> and a <strong>typographic scale</strong>. To maintain consistency in the design, I used multiples of <strong>8</strong> for spacing between elements.</p>
				<p>Based on the findings from the discovery phase, I made modifications and implemented design and functionality to address the identified pain points.</p>

			<h2>UI Design</h2>
			<div class="step">
				<h3>Final Design</h3>
				<p>I have created a <strong>UI Kit</strong> containing design specifications such as colors, typography, icons, grid, spacing, buttons, cards, media, and input fields.</p>
				<p>The colors used in the website design were selected from the branding to maintain consistency. The primary <strong>accent color</strong> chosen is <strong>orange</strong>, a color that stands out well within the site and highlights the main CTAs.</p>
				<p>The selected font is Google's <strong>Inter</strong> font, which is simple, versatile, and has good readability even on small screens.</p>

			<h2>User Testing</h2>
			<div class="step">

				<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
				<p>I will conduct an unmoderated <strong>5-second test</strong> to assess the comprehension of the "Above the fold" section of the homepage and the organization's activity, as well as an <strong>unmoderated Usability Test</strong>. </p>
				<p>Both tests will be conducted to gather both quantitative and qualitative data, evaluating the website's understandability at first glance and identifying user navigation patterns and the ability to complete tasks through clicks and heatmaps.</p>	
                    <p><strong>Quantitative</strong> data will be based on the completion success rate of a task: <strong>Direct Success</strong> (participant successfully completes the task by reaching the required page directly), <strong>Indirect Success</strong> (participant completes the task by reaching the required page through an alternative path), and <strong>Task Abandoned</strong> (participant is unable to complete the task).</p>
					<p><strong>Qualitative</strong> data will be obtained from the <strong>5-second test</strong> and the <strong>questions</strong> asked at the end of the test.</p>
					
					<h4>Objectives:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Determine whether the user is able to <strong>navigate</strong> the website and complete actions easily.</li>
						<li>Identify whether the organization's activity is easily <strong>understandable</strong>.</li>
						<li>Gather <strong>feedback</strong> regarding the design and functionality.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Test procedure:</h4>
					<p>The test will be conducted using the <strong>UserBerry</strong> testing tool, which allows me to test the Figma prototype.</p>
					<p>With the help of clicks and heatmaps, I obtained insights on user flow and website navigation.</p>

					<h4>Version analyzed:</h4>
					<p>The <strong>desktop</strong> version of the prototype will be analyzed as it provides a larger screen size, making it easier to identify pain points during the testing process.</p>

					<h4>Partecipants:</h4>
					<p>The test will be conducted with <strong>5</strong> participants who are dog lovers and have a medium to high level of technological proficiency. These participants will be selected after completing a screening test to ensure they align with the organization's target audience.</p>

					<p>Enjoy the test!</p>
					<p><li>The screens are just prototypes.</li>
                    <li>Actions will not be performed for real.</li>
                    <li>You can click anywhere.</li></p>

					<h4>5-second Test:</h4>
                    <p>Observe the screen that will be shown to you. *Userberry displays the Homepage screen for 5 seconds*</p>

					<p><strong>Scenario:</strong>Imagine you are a person interested in adopting a dog. You have heard about the organization and their commitment to rescuing stray dogs and finding them a new home. You have decided to visit the Sochi Dogs website to learn more and find a suitable dog for your family.</p>
                    <p>Please note that since the website is a prototype, not all parts are functional, so don't worry if clicking on something doesn't result in any action. Focus only on the final action.</p>
                    <p>Also, remember that this is not a test of you, but of the product I will show you. There are no right or wrong answers.</p>
					<p><strong>Task 1:</strong>Find information about the cost of adoptions.</p>
					<p><strong>Task 2:</strong>Adopt Byron.</p>
					<p><strong>Task 3:</strong>Make a donation to SochiDogs.</p>

					<h4>Final questions:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Describe your impression of the design in one word.</li>
						<li>How much trust does the service and the website inspire in you?</li>
						<li>Describe the functioning of the website in one word.</li>
					</ul>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Qualitative data:</strong>
                        Most of the participants correctly identified the activity carried out by the organization. 
                        The first thing they noticed when looking at the homepage was the image in the hero section, although one participant noticed the primary CTAs first. 
                        The logo went unnoticed, so the participants did not learn the brand name. The text in the hero section was also not noticed much, but the positioning of the dog with its gaze directed towards the text will draw the user's attention to the CTA.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

					<img src="assets/images/task3-ivegan.png" alt="success rate task3">
					<p><strong>Quantitative data:</strong>Most of the participants completed the task directly, immediately locating the "Donate" button at the top right of the Navbar and accessing the donation page. Only one participant completed the task indirectly, accessing the donation page through the "Get Involved" page.</p>
					
					<br>
                    <br>

						<li>Intuitive.</li>
						<li>Simple.</li>
						<li>Easy.</li>
						<li>Correct.</li>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Qualitative data:</strong>
                        The design and functionality of the website were understood and appreciated, being considered clear and simple.<br>
                        The service inspired trust and reliability in the participants, being perceived as professional and inviting.</p>

                        <br>
                        <br>

                    <h4>&#10233;Upgrades</h4>
					<p>I made the logo in the Header larger to make it more noticeable, and I used the version with the gradient branding to make it stand out even more.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I modified the copy in the Hero section, changing it to "SochiDogs is rescuing dogs in Ukraine" instead of "We are rescuing dogs in Ukraine" to make the brand name more prominent.</p>
