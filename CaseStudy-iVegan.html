			<h2>Research</h2>
			<div class="step">
				<h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
				<p>To determine whether the current desktop and mobile versions of the website comply with usability and functionality criteria, an analysis was conducted using Nielsen's <strong> 10 heuristics</strong>. 
					This allowed me to identify the <strong>strengths</strong> and <strong>weaknesses</strong> of the iVegan website.</p>
				
					<h4>Usability</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Learnability:</strong> At first glance, the user is able to perform the main tasks (e.g. purchase), but not all categories are immediately visible.</li>
						<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The user is able to learn the site's navigation, although not always in a smooth manner (e.g. some categories are not immediately identifiable and there is no flexibility in filtering products).</li>
						<li><strong>Memorability:</strong>The user is able to use the site with the same ability even after a period of time.</li>
						<li><strong>Errors:</strong> The user is generally able to avoid errors. Some actions, if done by mistake, cannot be undone (e.g. deleting a product from the cart).</li>
						<li><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> The design is not minimalist and not in line with current trends. The content is overly compact and does not allow the page to breathe.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
					<img src="assets/images/site-map.png" alt="site-map-iVegan-website">
					
					<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>To determine iVegan's <strong>strengths</strong> and <strong>weaknesses</strong> compared to other companies operating in the same market, a comparative analysis was carried out with <strong>5</strong> of the main <strong>vegan stores</strong>.</p>
					<p>The direct competitors of iVegan are <strong>Italian e-commerce</strong> companies that sell <strong>vegan</strong> and <strong></strong>organic products, both food and non-food.</p>
					<img src="assets/images/table-competitors.png" alt="iVegan-competitors-analysis">
					<h4>&#10233;Analysis Results</h4>
					<p>From the analysis emerged the differences between iVegan's website and those of the analyzed competitors.</p>
					<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> presence of a <strong>live chat</strong>, indication of product <strong>expiration date</strong>, display of <strong>best-selling</strong> products.</p>
					<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> lack of <strong>FAQ</strong> and <strong>reviews</strong>, limited <strong>filtering</strong> options, no link to <strong>social media</strong> profiles, fewer <strong>payment options</strong> compared to most competitors.</p>
					
					<h3>User Research</h3>
					<p>iVegan's target audience was identified by observing reviews on the web and analyzing interactions on social media profiles (Facebook and Instagram).</p>
					<p>From research on the web and social media, a <strong>mixed target audience</strong> emerged, consisting <strong>mainly</strong> of <strong>women</strong>, aged between <strong>25</strong> and <strong>35 years old</strong>, with a <strong>medium to medium-high income range</strong>.</p>
					<p>To verify the accuracy of the research and obtain additional insights into the lifestyle and purchasing habits of the target audience, a <strong>16-question survey</strong> was administered to a group of people who follow a vegan lifestyle. The survey collected 49 responses, obtained from friends, relatives, and users on social media groups dedicated to the vegan lifestyle.</p>
					<img src="assets/images/survey.png" alt="survey-iVegan-website" class="survey">
					<h4>&#10233;Survey Results</h4>
					<p><strong>57%</strong> of the respondents to the questionnaire are <strong>women</strong>, aged <strong>between 25 and 34</strong>. The users are mostly <strong>workers</strong> (<strong>59%</strong>). <strong>47%</strong> follow an <strong>exclusively vegan</strong> diet and mainly purchase food products, prioritizing the <strong>quality/price ratio</strong>. The majority of users make purchases both <strong>in-store and online</strong> (<strong>48%</strong>), with 28% preferring online over physical stores, and using <strong>both PC and mobile</strong> devices to make purchases (<strong>42%</strong>). For users, the presence of <strong>filters</strong> and <strong>FAQs</strong> on a website is very important, followed by recently viewed products, live chat, and the Compare Products function.</p>
					
					<h3>User Personas</h3>
					<p>With the data optained from the research and survey, i was able to create three <strong>Personas</strong> representing three different user groups, with different expectations, needs and goals.</p>
					<img src="assets/images/user1.png" alt="user persona 1">
					<img src="assets/images/user2.png" alt="user persona 2">
					<img src="assets/images/user3.png" alt="user persona 3">

					<h3>User Journey Map</h3>
					<p>I created a User Journey Map to identify the <strong>pain points</strong> and <strong>feelings</strong> the user may go through while using the current website and the possible <strong>improvement opportunities</strong>.</p>

			<h2>Wireframing</h2>
			<div class="step">
				<h3>Wireframes Mobile and desktop</h3>
				<p>I created wireframes for 5 pages.</p>
				<p>To ensure the best functionality of the website i designed the wireframes <strong>Mobile-first</strong>.</p>
				<p>To create a consinstent design I started with low-fidelity wireframes drawn on paper, that I, then, recreated digitally in High-fidelity with Figma, following a Grid and a typographic scale, which allowed me to reorganize the elements present on the website and improve their hierarchy, making the website look more <strong>minimalistic.</strong></p>

				<h3>Screenflow</h3>
				<img src="assets/images/screenflow-mobile.png" alt="screen flow wireframes mobile">
				<img src="assets/images/screenflow-desktop.png" alt="screenflow wireframes desktop">
			</div>

			<h2>UI Design</h2>
			<div class="step">
				<h3>Final Design</h3>
				<p>Firstly, I created a <strong>design system</strong> that contains information about the grids used, the spacing between elements, typography size and weight, icons and the different button and forms in various states. Starting from the logo design, I identified the colors to be used, analyzing their contrast, to ensure good <strong>accessibility</strong> and <strong>readability</strong>.</p>
				<p>Then, I moved on to designing the pages and the way in which the user will interact with them and the elements present, creating an interface with a <strong>minimal</strong> appearance and <strong>easy-to-understand</strong> functionality.</p>

			<h2>User Testing</h2>
			<div class="step">

				<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
				<p>I will conduct a <strong>moderated usability test</strong>. 
					Thanks to this type of test, I will be able to obtain both <strong>quantitative</strong> and <strong>qualitative</strong> data by observing participants' behavior during interactions with the design.</p>
					<p><strong>Quantitative</strong> data will be based on the success rate of the task completion.</p>
					<p><strong>Qualitative</strong> data will be optained from user observations and behavior.</p>
					
					<h4>Objectives:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Determine if the user is able to <strong>navigate</strong> the website and complete <strong>purchases</strong> and <strong>actions</strong> easily.</li>
						<li>Identify <strong>Pain points</strong> and <strong>areas of confusion</strong> for the user.</li>
						<li>Optain <strong>feedback</strong> regarding the design.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4>Test procedure:</h4>
					<p>The test will be conducted <strong>remotely</strong> via Google Meet.</p>
					<p>As the sole facilitator, the test will be <strong>recorded</strong> (using OBS) and analyzed later. </p>
					<p>A pilot test will be conducted before the actual test.</p>

					<h4>Version analyzed:</h4>
					<p><strong>Desktop</strong>, as it is easier to obtain feedback on design and layout thanks to the larger screen size, making it faster to catch any potential errors or issues.</p>

					<h4>Partecipants:</h4>
					<p>To ensure the collection of sufficient data, <strong>6</strong> participants will take the test, selected based on target research conducted in the "Research" phase. </p>
					<p>The test will be conducted by people who are not familiar with iVegan, including 3 with more experience in using technology devices, the web, and that frequently purchase online, and 3 with less experience, to ensure that the design and its features are minimal, easy to use, and intuitive for different types of people.</p>

					<h4>Script</h4>
					<h4>Introduction:</h4>
					<p>*Checking for technical issues and disabling prototype hotspot.*</p>
					<p>Welcome and thank you for taking the time to speak with me.</p>
					<p>First of all, let me give you a brief summary. The test will be on the website of an Italian store that sells food and non-food products. The session will last a maximum of 1 hour and will be recorded, as stated in the privacy agreement you signed. Is that still okay with you?</p>
					<p>Perfect. If you need a break or want to stop the test, you can do so at any time.</p>
					<p>This is not a test about you, but about the product I will show you. There are no right or wrong answers, in fact, your honest opinion will be of great help in improving the product. As the website is a prototype, not all parts are functional, so don't worry if clicking on something doesn't do anything.</p>
					<p>During the session, I will give you some tasks to perform, and I would like you to do them calmly and as if you were alone, and please, think out loud and tell me what you see and what you think will happen before performing an action. shows an example</p>
					<p>If you have any questions during the tasks, I probably won't be able to answer immediately as I am observing how people use the site without any help, but if you still have questions at the end of the test, I will try to answer them then.</p>
					<p>Do you have any questions for me before we start?</p>

					<h4>Warm up questions:</h4>
					<p>Before looking at the website, tell me a little bit about yourself.</p>

						<li>Do you often use the computer?</li>
						<li>Do you often make online purchases?</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Tour Homepage:</h4>
					<p>Okay, great. Now, I would like to ask you to share your screen. You can do this by clicking on "Present Now". Before sharing, please make sure to close any pages you don't want to be recorded. </p>
					<p>The recording will start now. </p>
					<p>Please click on the link I sent you in the chat. Look at this page, you can scroll through it, but don't click anything yet.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What do you think this site does?</li>
						<li>What is your first impression?</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Tasks:</h4>
					<p>I will give you a scenario and ask you to perform some tasks within the website, which I will read out loud and also share in the chat.</p>
					<p>Please remember to try and think out loud as much as possible.</p>
					<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> You are organizing a surprise party for your vegan friend's birthday and while searching online for vegan products, you came across iVegan.</p>
					<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> You want to purchase a veggie burger, what do you do?</p>
					<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Since you will have it delivered to your house, you are interested in knowing if the burger will be delivered frozen or not. Where do you click?</p>
					<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> You are ready to finalize the purchase, what would you do?</p>

					<h4>Follow up questions:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>What was your impression of the design?</li>
						<li>How did you find using the website?</li>
						<li>Do you have any feedback you would like to share?</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Wrap up:</h4>
					<p>The test is over.</p>
					<p>The recording will now be stopped.</p>
					<p>Thank you for your availability and your time!</p>
					<p>Before concluding, do you have any questions for me?</p>
					<p>As a last thing, I have sent you a short questionnaire (SUS questionnaire) by email, which I kindly ask you to answer.</p>
					<p>As agreed, tomorrow you will receive an email with an Amazon voucher worth 10 euros.</p>
					<p>Thank you again for your time!</p>

					</ul>

					<h4>What is your first impression? / What was your impression of the design?</h4>
					<p>Key words:</p>
					<p>Simple - Easy - Intuitive - Clear - Organized - Consistent Look - Appropriate Colors</p>

					<h4>How did you find using the website?</h4>
					<p>Key words:</p>
					<p>Easy - Simple - Minimal - Intuitive - Understandable - Functional</p>

					<h4>Task 1: You want to purchase a veggie burger, what do you do?</h4>
					<img src="assets/images/task1-ivegan.png" alt="success rate task1">
					<p><strong>Quantitative data:</strong> All participants, both experts and non-experts, were able to find and add the product to the cart easily.</p>
					<p><strong>Qualitative data:</strong> None of the participants reported any areas of confusion. Less experienced participants appreciated the ability to access categories in different ways (search, navbar, section on the homepage).</p>

					<h4>Task 2: Since you will have it delivered to your house, you are interested in knowing if the burger will be delivered frozen or not. Where do you click?</h4>
					<img src="assets/images/task2-ivegan.png" alt="success rate task2">
					<p><strong>Quantitative data:</strong> All the expert participants directly reached the FAQ page by going straight to the footer, while 2 of the less experienced ones completed the task indirectly, as they saw the presence of the live chat and clicked on its icon. Inside the live chat, before sending a message, they were redirected through the copy to the FAQ page.</p>
					<p><strong>Qualitative data:</strong> One of the non-expert participants became confused by the copy 'Phone Orders/Assistance,' focusing on that section and wondering if they should call the phone number provided to request information.</p>

					<h4>Task 3: You are ready to finalize the purchase, what would you do?</h4>
					<img src="assets/images/task3-ivegan.png" alt="success rate task3">
					<p><strong>Quantitative data:</strong> All participants, both experts and non-experts, were able to complete the task by clicking on the cart icon and accessing the checkout page.</p>
					<p><strong>Qualitative data:</strong> The non-expert participants, while completing the fields required to finalize the order, paused at the discount code field wondering whether they should enter a code.</p>

					<h4>&#10233;Upgrades</h4>
					<ul>
					<li>Change the copy from "Ordini telefonici/Assistenza" to "Ordini telefonici" to avoid confusion and prevent users from calling the store instead of searching for the information they need on the website.</li>
					</ul>
					<img src="assets/images/changes1-ivegan.png" alt="changes1 ivegan">
					<ul>
					<li>Hide the discount code input field by displaying it only when the user clicks on "Do you have a discount code?" as it is done on mobile, to avoid distractions and/or checkout abandonment by customers who do not have a discount code.</li>
					</ul>
