			<h2>Research</h2>
			<div class="step">
				<h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
				<p>To determine whether the current desktop and mobile versions of the website comply with usability and functionality criteria, an analysis was conducted using Nielsen's <strong> 10 heuristics</strong>. 
					This allowed me to identify the <strong>strengths</strong> and <strong>weaknesses</strong> of the iVegan website.</p>
				
					<h4>Usability</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Learnability:</strong> At first glance, the user is able to perform the main tasks (e.g. purchase), but not all categories are immediately visible.</li>
						<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The user is able to learn the site's navigation, although not always in a smooth manner (e.g. some categories are not immediately identifiable and there is no flexibility in filtering products).</li>
						<li><strong>Memorability:</strong>The user is able to use the site with the same ability even after a period of time.</li>
						<li><strong>Errors:</strong> The user is generally able to avoid errors. Some actions, if done by mistake, cannot be undone (e.g. deleting a product from the cart).</li>
						<li><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> The design is not minimalist and not in line with current trends. The content is overly compact and does not allow the page to breathe.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
					<img src="images/site-map.png" alt="site-map-iVegan-website">
					
					<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>To determine iVegan's <strong>strengths</strong> and <strong>weaknesses</strong> compared to other companies operating in the same market, a comparative analysis was carried out with <strong>5</strong> of the main <strong>vegan stores</strong>.</p>
					<p>The direct competitors of iVegan are <strong>Italian e-commerce</strong> companies that sell <strong>vegan</strong> and <strong></strong>organic products, both food and non-food.</p>
					<img src="images/table-competitors.png" alt="iVegan-competitors-analysis">
					<h4>&#10233;Analysis Results</h4>
					<p>From the analysis emerged the differences between iVegan's website and those of the analyzed competitors.</p>
					<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> presence of a <strong>live chat</strong>, indication of product <strong>expiration date</strong>, display of <strong>best-selling</strong> products.</p>
					<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> lack of <strong>FAQ</strong> and <strong>reviews</strong>, limited <strong>filtering</strong> options, no link to <strong>social media</strong> profiles, fewer <strong>payment options</strong> compared to most competitors.</p>
					
					<h3>User Research</h3>
					<p>iVegan's target audience was identified by observing reviews on the web and analyzing interactions on social media profiles (Facebook and Instagram).</p>
					<p>From research on the web and social media, a <strong>mixed target audience</strong> emerged, consisting <strong>mainly</strong> of <strong>women</strong>, aged between <strong>25</strong> and <strong>35 years old</strong>, with a <strong>medium to medium-high income range</strong>.</p>
					<p>To verify the accuracy of the research and obtain additional insights into the lifestyle and purchasing habits of the target audience, a <strong>16-question survey</strong> was administered to a group of people who follow a vegan lifestyle. The survey collected 49 responses, obtained from friends, relatives, and users on social media groups dedicated to the vegan lifestyle.</p>
					<img src="images/survey.png" alt="survey-iVegan-website" class="survey">
					<h4>&#10233;Survey Results</h4>
					<p><strong>57%</strong> of the respondents to the questionnaire are <strong>women</strong>, aged <strong>between 25 and 34</strong>. The users are mostly <strong>workers</strong> (<strong>59%</strong>). <strong>47%</strong> follow an <strong>exclusively vegan</strong> diet and mainly purchase food products, prioritizing the <strong>quality/price ratio</strong>. The majority of users make purchases both <strong>in-store and online</strong> (<strong>48%</strong>), with 28% preferring online over physical stores, and using <strong>both PC and mobile</strong> devices to make purchases (<strong>42%</strong>). For users, the presence of <strong>filters</strong> and <strong>FAQs</strong> on a website is very important, followed by recently viewed products, live chat, and the Compare Products function.</p>
					
					<h3>User Personas</h3>
					<p>With the data optained from the research and survey, i was able to create three <strong>Personas</strong> representing three different user groups, with different expectations, needs and goals.</p>

					<img src="images/user2.png" alt="user persona 2">
					<img src="images/user3.png" alt="user persona 3">

					<h3>User Journey Map</h3>
					<p>I created a User Journey Map to identify the <strong>pain points</strong> and <strong>feelings</strong> the user may go through while using the current website and the possible <strong>improvement opportunities</strong>.</p>

					<h3>Service Blueprint</h3>
					<img src="images/service-blueprint.svg" alt="service blueprint-iVegan-website">
			</div>

			<h2>Wireframing</h2>
			<div class="step">
				<h3>Wireframes Mobile and desktop</h3>
				<p>I created wireframes for 5 pages.</p>
				<p>To ensure the best functionality of the website i designed the wireframes <strong>Mobile-first</strong>.</p>
				<p>To create a consinstent design I started with low-fidelity wireframes drawn on paper, that I, then, recreated digitally in High-fidelity with Figma, following a Grid and a typographic scale, which allowed me to reorganize the elements present on the website and improve their hierarchy, making the website look more <strong>minimalistic.</strong></p>

			</div>

			<h2>UI Design</h2>
			<div class="step">
				<h3>Final Design</h3>
				<p>Firstly, I created a <strong>design system</strong> that contains information about the grids used, the spacing between elements, typography size and weight, icons and the different button and forms in various states. Starting from the logo design, I identified the colors to be used, analyzing their contrast, to ensure good <strong>accessibility</strong> and <strong>readability</strong>.</p>
				<p>Then, I moved on to designing the pages and the way in which the user will interact with them and the elements present, creating an interface with a <strong>minimal</strong> appearance and <strong>easy-to-understand</strong> functionality.</p>

			<h2>User Testing</h2>
			<div class="step">
				<h3>Heatmap & AOI</h3>
				<div class="heatmap-aoi">
					<div class="Heatmap">
						<h4>Heatmap Analysis:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>In the new design the users attention appears more <strong>consistent</strong> than the Current one. </li>
							<li>The clean and structured design allows the user to notice and keep their <strong>attention</strong> on <strong>important elements</strong> more.</li>
							<li>In the new design <strong>every element</strong> of the page <strong>is seen</strong> by the user, unlike the current design where some elements get lost (ex. Caregories on the left side of the page).</li>
							<li>The Hero is now more <strong>evident</strong>, with a catchy image and text, and a <strong>clear</strong> Call to Action.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="AOI">
						<h4>AOI (area of interest) Analysis:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The new design increases the visibility of the logo (Logo attention increase of <strong>4.6%</strong>).</li>
							<li>The new Hero manages to catch the attention of <strong>78%</strong> of users.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<img src="images/heatmap-aoi.png" alt="heatmap comparison between the old landing page and the redesigned landing page ">

				<h3>Focus Map</h3>
				<p>To better show the difference between the two designs, a focus map was also structured, 
					which confirms what emerged from the Heatmap. Attention is distributed <strong>more evenly</strong> in the new design, 
					allowing important elements (Hero, product cards, CTA) to be <strong>better identified</strong> and <strong>attract</strong> the 
					user's <strong>attention</strong> more effectively.</p>
				<p>In addition, in the new design, there are significantly <strong>fewer elements that go unnoticed</strong> (in particular,
					on the current website, the categories of products offered by iVegan,
					located on the left side of the page, go mostly unnoticed).</p>
