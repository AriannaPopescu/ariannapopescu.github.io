# Arianna Popescu Portfolio

Hi! This is my personal UX/UI Design Portofolio, that I created to showcase my UX/UI design projects. <br/>
<br/>
It's made of a presentational Homepage, an About me page (where I talk a bit about myself), a page containing my resume, a page containing my ptojects and pages with an in-depth description of each project.

## File Contents
- HTML (Index, Projects, CaseStudy-iVegan, About, Resume)
- Assets (Images folder, CSS, JS)

## How to see the Website
